# Welcome to my Spring Boot/React JWT Auth Demo

This project was made out of the desire to teach myself user authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens. I also wanted to test my knowledge of using a Spring Book framework for my backend REST API, implenting a peristence layer using hibernate and JPA to query a MySQL database, and extending my knowledge by creating a stateless frontend using React.

I want to give a big shoutout to Coding Dojo and Dennis Iluma over on his YouTube channel: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PhegonDev">PhegonDev</a>. The knowledge I garned at Coding Dojo made a strong base for me to build on with this project. PhegonDev helped provide fantastic examples of core concepts explored in the Spring Security documentation.
